abstract = {SYNOPSIS: All animals experience performance trade-offs as they complete tasks such as capturing prey, defending territories, acquiring mates, and escaping predators. Why then, is it so hard to detect performance trade-offs at the whole-organismal level? Why do we sometimes even obtain positive correlations between two performance traits that are predicted to be negatively associated? Here we explore two plausible explanations. First, most analyses are based on individual maximal values (i.e., personal best), which could introduce a bias in the correlation estimates. Second, phenotypic correlations alone may be poor indicators of a trade-off when contrasting processes occur at the among- versus within-individual levels. One such scenario is the ``big houses big cars'' model developed in life-history theory to explain the existence of ``uberfleas'' that are superior in all regards (because they acquire more resources than others). We highlight that the exact opposite scenario might occur for performance trade-offs, where among-individual trade-offs may be masked by within-individual changes in physical condition. One of the best ways to test among these alternative scenarios is to collect repeated pairs of performance traits and analyze them using multivariate mixed models (MMMs). MMMs allow straightforward and simultaneous examination of trait correlations at the among- and within-individual levels. We use a simple simulation tool (SQuID package in R) to create a population of Krakens, a mythical giant squid-like sea creature whose morphology generates a performance trade-off between swimming speed and strength or ability to sink ships. The simulations showed that using individual maximum values introduces a bias that is particularly severe when individuals differ in the number of repeated samples (ntrial). Finally, we show how MMMs can help detect performance (or any other type of) trade-offs and offer additional insights (e.g., help detect plasticity integration). We hope researchers will adopt MMMs when exploring trade-offs in whole-animal performances.

Three different egg-laying patterns were observed. Among the biotic parameters studied; previtellogenic follicular atresia, number of oocytes per ovariole at imaginal moult, female life expectancy, and ovarian activity explained female successful responses to local weather conditions. Follicular atresia, combined with a low number of oocytes, impeded oviposition in a low percentage of females from Montr{\'e}al. It also impedes the production of a third brood in the Vancouver population, and of a fourth brood in the San Francisco population. Both female life expectancy and length of ovarian activity also had a significant impact on the oviposition pattern in the three climatic regions. Under the cold temperate climate of the Montr{\'e}al area, only one brood was produced due to the short period of female fertility. Longer period of fertility and life expectancy enabled females to produce two broods in the milder temperate climate of Vancouver, and three broods in the San Francisco climate.

abstract = {Body mass components (dry mass, lean dry mass, water mass, fat mass) in each sex correlate strongly with body mass and pronotum length in Gryllus texensis and Acheta domesticus. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression underestimates the scaling relationship between body mass and structural size (i.e., pronotum length) in both cricket species compared with standard major axis (SMA) regression. Standardized mass components correlate more strongly with scaled mass index ([Formula: see text]) than with residual body mass (R i). R i represents the residuals from an OLS regression of log body mass against log pronotum length. Neither condition index predicts energy stores (i.e., fat content) in G. texensis. R i is not correlated with energy stores in A. domesticus whereas [Formula: see text] is negatively correlated. A comparison of condition index methods using published data showed that neither sex nor diet quality affected body condition at adulthood in G. texensis when using the scaled mass index. However, the residual index suggested that sex had a significant effect on body condition. Further, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suggested that diet quality significantly affects body mass while statistically controlling for body size (i.e., body condition). We conclude that the statistical assumptions of condition index methods must be met prior to use and urge caution when using methods that are based on least squares in the y -plane (i.e., residual index ANCOVA).}, }

abstract = {Parasites produce from just a few to many eggs of variable size, but our understanding of the factors driving variation in these two life history traits at the intraspecific level is still very fragmentary. This study evaluates the importance of performing multilevel analyses on egg number and egg size, while characterising parasite life history strategies. A total of 120 ovigerous females of Octopicola superba (Copepoda: Octopicolidae) (one sample (n=30) per season) were characterised with respect to different body dimensions (total length; genital somite length) and measures of reproductive effort (fecundity; mean egg diameter; total reproductive effort; mean egg sac length). While endoparasites are suggested to follow both an r- and K-strategy simultaneously, the evidence found in this and other studies suggests that environmental conditions force ectoparasites into one of the two alternatives. The positive and negative skewness of the distributions of fecundity and mean egg diameter, respectively, suggest that O. superba is mainly a K-strategist (i.e. produces a relatively small number of large, well provisioned eggs). Significant sample differences were recorded concomitantly for all body dimensions and measures of reproductive effort, while a general linear model detected a significant influence of season*parasite total length in both egg number and size. This evidence suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity in body dimensions and size-mediated changes in egg production. Seasonal changes in partitioning of resources between egg number and size resulted in significant differences in egg sac length but not in total reproductive effort. Evidence for a trade-off between egg number and size was found while controlling for a potential confounding effect of parasite total length. However, this trade-off became apparent only at high fecundity levels, suggesting a state of physiological exhaustion.}, }

abstract = {In many organisms, large offspring have improved fitness over small offspring, and thus their size is under strong selection. However, due to a trade-off between offspring size and number, females producing larger offspring necessarily must produce fewer unless the total amount of reproductive effort is unlimited. Because differential gene expression among environments may affect genetic covariances among traits, it is important to consider environmental effects on the genetic relationships among traits. We compared the genetic relationships among egg size, lifetime fecundity, and female adult body mass (a trait linked to reproductive effort) in the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, between two environments (host-plant species Acacia greggii and Cercidium floridum). Genetic correlations among these traits were estimated through half-sib analysis, followed with artificial selection on egg size to observe the correlated responses of lifetime fecundity and female body mass. We found that the magnitude of the genetic trade-off between egg size and lifetime fecundity differed between environments--a strong trade-off was estimated when females laid eggs on C. floridum seeds, yet this trade-off was weak when females laid eggs on A. greggii seeds. Also differing between environments was the genetic correlation between egg size and female body mass-these traits were positively genetically correlated for egg size on A. greggii seeds, yet uncorrelated on C. floridum seeds. On A. greggii seeds, the evolution of egg size and traits linked to reproductive effort (such as female body mass) are not independent from each other as commonly assumed in life-history theory.},

abstract = {Insect parental care is extensive and varied, but its life-history implications have never been comparatively tested. Using original and literature data, we tested predictions about egg size, egg number (lifetime fecundity), and body size under different parental care modes across a phylogeny of 287 insect species. Life-history theory and both comparative and intraspecific evidence from ectotherms suggest parental care should select for bigger, fewer eggs, but that allometric scaling of egg size and lifetime fecundity may depend on whether care consists of provisioning (density-dependent offspring survival) or merely guarding (density-independent offspring survival). Against expectation, egg size was indistinguishable among parental care modes, covarying only with body size. This refutes most theory of egg size evolution under parental care. Lifetime fecundity scaled differently depending on parental investment-positively under no care and guarding, as in most ectotherms, but negatively under provisioning. Reproductive allocation in provisioning insects resembled that in mammals and birds, also groups with obligate provisioning. We propose that the metabolic demands of multiple offspring must scale with species body size more steeply than the parent's provisioning capacity, resulting in larger females laying fewer eggs. These patterns lay the groundwork for a more general understanding of parental care and life history.},

abstract = {Traditionally, research on life-history traits has viewed the link between clutch size and offspring size as a straightforward linear trade-off; the product of these two components is taken as a measure of maternal reproductive output. Investing more per egg results in fewer but larger eggs and, hence, offspring. This simple size-number trade-off has proved attractive to modellers, but our experimental studies on keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Colubridae) reveal a more complex relationship between clutch size and offspring size. At constant water availability, the amount of water taken up by a snake egg depends upon the number of adjacent eggs. In turn, water uptake affects hatchling size, and therefore an increase in clutch size directly increases offspring size (and thus fitness under field conditions). This allometric advantage may influence the evolution of reproductive traits such as growth versus reproductive effort, optimal age at female maturation, the body-reserve threshold required to initiate reproduction and nest-site selection (e.g. communal oviposition). The published literature suggests that similar kinds of complex effects of clutch size on offspring viability are widespread in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Our results also challenge conventional experimental methodologies such as split-clutch designs for laboratory incubation studies: by separating an egg from its siblings, we may directly affect offspring size and thus viability.},

Repeat spawners had heavier eggs than similar‐sized first time spawners. The egg mass of residents wasc.10\% larger than that of similar‐sized first time spawning anadromous trout. Common garden experiments with offspring of wild anadromous trout showed no significant correlation between egg and somatic mass in first time spawners in two of the three populations studied. In the third population, a slight positive correlation was found. Similar results were found for repeat spawners. In the three populations, fecundity increased significantly with somatic mass in both first time and repeat spawners. Wild and hatchery‐reared trout showed negative correlation between egg mass and fecundity when the effect of body size was excluded, indicating a trade‐off between the two parameters. In wild trout, this was caused by variation among populations, whereas in hatchery fish, within population variation was observed in egg mass over fecundity. Furthermore, the egg mass of first time and repeat spawners were positively correlated, when adjusted for fish size. Size‐specific gonadal investment was significantly higher in wild anadromous than resident trout. There was no significant difference in gonadal investment between first time and repeat spawners in wild anadromous trout. However, in the hatchery‐reared trout, gonadal investment was significantly higher at repeat than first time maturation. The hatchery trout did not spawn naturally, but were artificially stripped.

abstract = {We develop an extension of Schaffer's (1972) model for a simple life history with constant annual adult and juvenile survival rates. In contrast with previous models, we distinguish between total effort and effort per offspring. We assume that offspring production is the product of the juvenile survival rate and brood size, that the juvenile survival rate is a function of effort per offspring, and that brood size is a function of effort per offspring and total effort. We further assume that the adult survival rate is a function of total effort and that optimal combinations of effort per offspring and total effort are those resulting in the highest population growth rate. Optimal effort per offspring depends only on the minimal effort per offspring and the rate at which the juvenile survival rate increases with increasing effort per offspring. Optimal total effort depends on effort per offspring, the ratio between the realized juvenile survival rate and the maximal adult survival rate, and the threshold at which increasing total effort leads to sharp declines in the adult survival rate. The model and its predictions justify the inclusion of effort per offspring and total effort in descriptions of life history tactics and facilitate the formulation and testing of more-precise life history hypotheses. We suggest several experiments. The model predicts that the rate of increase in optimal total effort with increasing brood size decreases as brood size increases. The relative numbers of variables on which optimal total effort and effort per offspring depend suggest that current variability in effort per offspring should be less than variability in total effort}, }

However, understanding the behavioural mechanisms mediating the benefit of parental care is critical to advance research on the evolution of family interactions. Here, we report results from a study where we experimentally tested the hypothesis that European earwig (Forficula auricularia) females regurgitate food to their nymphs. We used a simple experimental method based on food dyes as colour markers to separate maternal food regurgitation and nymphal self‐feeding as the two components of food intake by nymphs. Two different food dyes were used to label the food offered to the earwig mother and the nymphs respectively. By analysing the colour of the gut content of the nymphs, we demonstrate significant food transfer from the mother to the nymphs. This study demonstrates unambiguously that maternal food regurgitation exists in earwigs and presents a simple and easily applicable technique to trace maternal food regurgitation in the study of insect parental care and family interactions.}, }

Thus, a series of experiments was performed to study the effects of genotypes, colony size and colony nutrition on variation in egg size produced by honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens. Queens from different genetic stocks produced significantly different egg sizes under similar environmental conditions, indicating standing genetic variation for egg size that allows for adaptive evolutionary change. Further investigations revealed that eggs produced by queens in large colonies were consistently smaller than eggs produced in small colonies, and queens dynamically adjusted egg size in relation to colony size. Similarly, queens increased egg size in response to food deprivation. These results could not be solely explained by different numbers of eggs produced in the different circumstances but instead seem to reflect an active adjustment of resource allocation by the queen in response to colony conditions. As a result, larger eggs experienced higher subsequent survival than smaller eggs, suggesting that honey bee queens might increase egg size under unfavourable conditions to enhance brood survival and to minimize costly brood care of eggs that fail to successfully develop, and thus conserve energy at the colony level. The extensive plasticity and genetic variation of egg size in honey bees has important implications for understanding life-history evolution in a social context and implies this neglected life-history stage in honey bees may have trans-generational effects.},

Dietary differences experienced by the female during larval development, and originating from different hosts or from reduced nutrient levels in artificial diets, did not affect Ei values; however, depletion of nutrients sufficient to reduce fertility greatly did reduce Ei. Temperature conditions during the ultimate larval and pupal stages influence Ei values which vary inversely. Mean egg weights are strongly heritable and are readily selected for, thereby demonstrating the presence of strong genetic control.}, }

abstract = {Causes of egg‐size variation between and within clutches were studied in clutches of the blue tit (Parus caeruleus L.). We measured the mass of each egg in the laying sequence in unmanipulated clutches, in clutches of parents experimentally supplied with extra food before egg‐laying, and in clutches of parents supplemented with extra food after the start of egg‐laying. Hatchlings were weighed at an age of two days and their mass was found to be positively related to egg mass. No general trend of decreasing or increasing egg mass was found within the laying sequence. Females provided with extra food before egg‐laying laid clutches with significantly less variation in egg mass than did control females. The reason for this was that the first‐laid egg of unmanipulated females was lighter than the rest of the eggs in the clutch. This pattern disappeared in clutches of females receiving extra food. Thus, the reduction in egg mass variation among clutches of foodsupplemented females depended on an ability of these females, in contrast to control females, to lay a first egg of the same mass as the rest of the clutch. Eggs laid after the initiation of incubation were significantly heavier than equivalent eggs in those clutches where incubation started after clutch completion. The difference was small, however, and the adaptive significance of the finding is questionable. We argue that intra‐clutch variation in egg mass is connected with greater fitness consequences than in inter‐clutch variation. Furthermore, our results indicate that energetical constraints on the laying female are more important as a cause of the observed intra‐clutch variation in egg mass than are adaptive responses to the environment.}, }

abstract = {Over the course of evolution, organism size has diversified markedly. Changes in size are thought to have occurred because of developmental, morphological and/or ecological pressures. To perform phylogenetic tests of the potential effects of these pressures, here we generated a dataset of more than ten thousand descriptions of insect eggs, and combined these with genetic and life-history datasets. We show that, across eight orders of magnitude of variation in egg volume, the relationship between size and shape itself evolves, such that previously predicted global patterns of scaling do not adequately explain the diversity in egg shapes. We show that egg size is not correlated with developmental rate and that, for many insects, egg size is not correlated with adult body size. Instead, we find that the evolution of parasitoidism and aquatic oviposition help to explain the diversification in the size and shape of insect eggs. Our study suggests that where eggs are laid, rather than universal allometric constants, underlies the evolution of insect egg size and shape.}, }

abstract = {AbstractThe size of reptile hatchlings can be phenotypically plastic in response to incubation temperature, and size is a trait likely to influence fitness -- i.e. hatchling size is proposed as an indicator of quality. The parental and incubation temperature effects on the size of one of New Zealand's most biologically significant reptile species, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are investigated. Artificial incubation at constant temperatures is used to produce founders for new captive and wild populations of tuatara and to augment existing rare populations. We compare size of hatchling tuatara from artificial and natural incubation treatments. The relationship of hatchling size with incubation temperature and sex is examined, and we investigate whether our results support differential fitness models for the evolution of temperature‐dependent sex determination in tuatara. Initial egg mass is the most important factor affecting size of hatchling tuatara and is still an important influence at 10 months of age. Incubation temperature does not greatly influence size of hatchlings, but significantly influences size by 10 months of age. Constant artificial incubation conditions result in larger, but possibly less aggressive, juveniles than those from more variable natural incubation conditions by 10 months of age. Evidence from size patterns of tuatara incubated in natural nests supports differential fitness models for the adaptive significance of temperature‐dependent sex determination. Thermal variation has little effect on size of male hatchlings, but female embryos that develop in more stable thermal conditions, in more reliable sites for hatching, are bigger and have longer jaws.}, }

Values of D are closer to zero in precocial than in altricial species; D is negatively correlated with body size in interspecific comparisons, i.e. large birds, including precocial species, lay small final eggs; and D is higher in open-nesting passerines (on average D = +3.56\%, 17 species) than in hole-nesting species (on average D = -0.05\%, 13 species). Within populations of birds, a negative relationship exists between D and clutch size, particularly in species that have a generally low value of D. The results support the view that intraclutch variation in egg size has an ultimate, adaptive value. We suggest that birds adopting the ``brood-reduction strategy'' have a small final egg, particularly those birds with large clutches, whereas birds adopting the ``brood-survival strategy'' have a relatively large final egg, particularly those birds with large clutches}, }
